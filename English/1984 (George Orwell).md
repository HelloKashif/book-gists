    - It is quite easy to take our democratic society for granted.
    - Very small changes in the government policies can have a disastrous long lasting impact on the society.

# Summary
    This book opened my eyes on the significance of a good government. We take our democracy for granted, skip votes and just simply do not know anything about an alternate possibility. We could equally have been born in a society where personal thoughts, basic freedom rights are nonexistent. Only when you read about these kind of things that you realize that we got lucky. And that we should do everything in our power to stop something like this from happening. 

I've seen lot of people complaining about the conservative parties and honestly I was also among the critics, but we need to understand that it is extremely difficult to make changes to policies and know in advance, the everlasting implications it could have on the generations to come. One wrong move could throw us in a dystopian world where there is no coming back.
